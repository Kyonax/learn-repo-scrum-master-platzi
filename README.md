# Summary
This `learn-repo` is a **documentation about the self-education course in agile methodologies and scrum** taken in the **Platzi's Scrum Master Course** complementing it with open source projects using the technologies learned, with the mission to create an educational background to support or validate the knowledge and experience with the technologies and tools dedicated to **Scrum.**

This repo is NOT replacing or transcribing any information that you can find in the actual course [Platzi Scrum Master](https://platzi.com/ruta/rol-de-scrum-master/), the repo is just a curriculum to show what I learned in the Platzi course, and to show what I can build with the technologies learned in it.

**Organization**. Course education structure:

- *User Stories Course in Scrum*
- *Scrum Master Course*
