#+TITLE: Scrum Team and Roles
#+AUTHOR: Kyonax - Cristian Moreno

The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity. Scrum teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities to receive feedback.

[#A] Things to have in mind:
- Minimize the external dependencies.
- Organization types.

[#A] Community Advices:
- Daily Scrum
  - Questions to answer:
    * What has been my contribution since the last Daily Scrum to help the team achieve the goal?
    * What will be my contribution starting today to help the team achieve the team's goal?
    * What kind of barriers am I having or am I going to have to fulfill the team's goal?
  - Structure:
    * What did I do Yesterday?
    * What will I do Today?
    * What things are blocking my work? or rasing alerts about possible delays and the reasons, to implement supportive measures to avoid potential delays.

** Development Team
A group of 3-9 people who collaboratively develop a product. The Development Team in Scrum has two core characteristics. It is cross-functional and self-organized. Cross-functional means that the team has all the skills or capabilities needed for product development.

*** Responsabilities

- Multifunctionals.
- Any one has tittles. No one is the boss.
- Doesn't exist sub-teams.
- The Development Team can't be modified until the Sprint finish.
